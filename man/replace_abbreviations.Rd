\title{Apply multiple string replacements to a data frame column.}
\usage{
replace_abbreviations(file, replacements, npass = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A data frame that must contain a column named \code{expression}.}

\item{replacements}{A data frame with at least two columns: \code{pattern}
(strings to be found) and \code{replacement} (strings to replace them with).}

\item{npass}{The number of passes to apply the replacements. Multiple
passes are useful if replacements can affect subsequent patterns.}
}
\value{
The input data frame \code{file} with the \code{expression} column modified
by the replacements.
}
\description{
This function iteratively applies a set of pattern-replacement pairs to the
'expression' column of a data frame. It performs multiple passes to ensure
all replacements are applied, even if they depend on previous replacements.
Patterns are treated as full words (or preceded by non-word characters and
followed by non-word characters or an opening parenthesis) to prevent
partial word matches.
